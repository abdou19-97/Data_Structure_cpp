# Solved Problem in Data Structure
In this repository there are some solved problems in Data Structure using C++ language, along with the sudocode.
In the root directory "Data_Structure_cpp" there are the solutions in the .cpp files, to test the code type or copy "g++ -o ./a.out fileName.cpp" for compiling and then hit enter, then type
or copy "./a.out" to run the code. In the "Data_Structure_cpp" folder here's a sub-folder called "sudocode" which contain the detailed steps for solving each problem.

Note: Not all the sudocode of those problems along with explanation available yet in the "sudocode" folder, but soon they'll be.
